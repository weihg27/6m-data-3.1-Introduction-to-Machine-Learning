## Glossary

Key terms from this lesson, in plain English. Terms in **bold** appear in the notebooks.

**Algorithm**
A recipe for solving a problem. In ML, the algorithm turns training data into a model. Examples: linear regression, decision tree, neural network.

**Classification**
A supervised learning task where the label is a category (positive/negative, spam/not-spam, cat/dog/bird). See also: regression.

**Confidence Score**
How sure the model is about a single prediction, usually expressed as a percentage or a number between 0 and 1. A 95% confidence on "POSITIVE" means the model is highly sure; a 55% confidence means it barely picked that label over the other. In practice, teams use confidence to decide which predictions to trust automatically and which to send to a human reviewer.

**Confusion Matrix**
A small 2×2 table that breaks down a classifier's predictions into four buckets: correct-positive, correct-negative, false-positive, and false-negative. Reveals exactly *where* the model fails — not just overall accuracy. Introduced in Part 3 of this lesson and used throughout the course.

**Deep Learning**
A sub-field of ML using neural networks with many layers. Covered in L07 onwards. Often used when classical ML plateaus on complex data like images, text, or audio.

**Deployment**
Putting a trained model where someone or something can use it — in a web service, a mobile app, or a batch pipeline.

**Feature**
An input to the model. For a customer, features could be age, city, number of past purchases. For a photo, features are the pixels (or learned representations of them).

**Feature Engineering**
The art of creating useful features from raw data. Often the highest-leverage part of an ML project. Covered in L04.

**Generative AI (GenAI)**
ML models that produce new content — text, images, audio, code. Covered in L10. Distinguished from *predictive* ML, which outputs a category or number.

**Hyperparameter**
A setting of the learning algorithm that *you* choose (not learned from data) — e.g., how deep a decision tree can grow, or how quickly a neural network learns. Covered in L04.

**Inference**
Using a trained model on new data to get predictions. Opposite of training.

**Label**
The correct answer for a training example. For sentiment analysis, the label is "positive" or "negative." Also called *target* or *ground truth*.

**Machine Learning (ML)**
A discipline that builds systems which improve at a task by learning from data, rather than being explicitly programmed.

**Model**
The learned mapping from features to predictions. Once trained, you use the model over and over for inference.

**Overfitting**
When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data. The model memorised rather than generalised. Covered in L03.

**Polarity**
A numeric score between -1 (fully negative) and +1 (fully positive) that a sentiment model outputs to describe how negative or positive a piece of text is. TextBlob returns a polarity score for every sentence. Unlike a bare "positive/negative" label, polarity tells you *how strongly* the model believes it.

**Pre-trained model**
A model someone else trained on a large dataset, which you can use directly (or fine-tune). Hugely useful — saves time, compute, and data.

**Precision and Recall**
Two complementary ways to measure a classifier's quality.

- **Precision** = of everything the model labelled positive, what fraction was *actually* positive? (Low precision means lots of false alarms.)
- **Recall** = of everything that was *actually* positive, what fraction did the model catch? (Low recall means missed real cases.)

The right trade-off depends on the cost of each kind of mistake. Covered in depth in L03.

**Regression**
A supervised learning task where the label is a number (house price, temperature, sales). See also: classification.

**Reinforcement Learning**
An ML category where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards. Covered conceptually in this lesson only.

**Supervised Learning**
An ML category where you train on labelled examples. Most business ML is supervised.

**Test set**
A portion of your data held out during training, used only to evaluate the final model. Simulates "performance on unseen data."

**Threshold**
The cut-off score above which a probabilistic or numeric prediction is treated as belonging to one class. A sentiment model might label everything with a polarity above 0 as "positive," but could just as well use 0.2 to be stricter. Most models default to a neutral mid-point, but real businesses rarely do — tuning the threshold is how you translate the business cost of being wrong in one direction versus the other into model behaviour. Covered in depth in L03.

**Training**
The process of an algorithm learning a model from labelled examples.

**Training set**
The data used during training. The model is allowed to see these examples and their labels.

**Unsupervised Learning**
An ML category where training data has no labels; the goal is to discover structure (clusters, patterns, anomalies).

**Validation set**
A third split (separate from training and test), used to tune hyperparameters without peeking at the test set. Introduced in L04.

## Cast of Characters — L01

**Sarah Chen** — Customer Experience Analyst, NorthStar Retail. Our protagonist across all 10 lessons. Starts with a business degree, a few SQL and Python evening courses, and no formal ML training. By the end of the course she is leading a small data science team.

**Priya Raman** — CMO at NorthStar and Sarah's manager in L01–L03. The one who hands Sarah the 10,000 reviews on her first Monday. Her recurring pressure — *"Show me the money, not the accuracy"* — will shape how every future model is evaluated.

**Aisha Patel** — Head of Customer Service. She carries the USB drive of reviews into Sarah's office in L01 and becomes a recurring source of real operational data across the course.

**Marcus Wong** — CTO. Appears briefly in L01, more prominently from L04 onward after an early model failure makes him cautious. His trust has to be earned.

**Tom Bradley** — Head of Analytics at **Lakeside Bank**, NorthStar's banking partner. You met him in the Phase 3 assignment. Tom's data is different from Sarah's, but the *approach* is the same — which is the whole point of the Lakeside secondment.
